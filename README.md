## ðŸ§µ erabytse-veil  
*An ethical veil for image metadata â€” not deletion, but intentional protection.*

> "Not all metadata should be hidden. But what is sensitive deserves a veil."

## ðŸŒ¿ Philosophy
- **GPS, timestamps, device IDs** â†’ veiled (privacy risk)  
- **Aperture, focal length, lens** â†’ preserved (creative value)  
- Every image is treated with **discernment, not fear**.

## âœ¨ Features (v0.1)
- Removes sensitive EXIF (GPS, precise timestamps, device IDs)  
- Preserves creative EXIF (f-stop, ISO, focal length)  
- Generates a clean output file â€” original untouched  
- **100% offline, no cloud, no tracking**

Part of **[erabytse](https://erabytse.github.io)** â€” a quiet rebellion against digital waste.
